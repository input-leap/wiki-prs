# History of Input Leap starts with Synergy

With the origins of input leap being more than two decades old, it has become quite hard to learn the whole story of this project.

As far as I can tell (and as far as I was able to remember), this is the chain of events that lead to input-leap:

* Apparently, in 1996 the original project was created as CosmoSynergy at SGI. I have no way of confirming this, but it is mentioned in the [Wikipedia article about Synergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy_(software)#History)
* early 2000s until ~2006 (release 1.3.1): Synergy by [Chris Schoenemann and a few contributors](https://web.archive.org/web/20070630222420if_/http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/authors.html) - hosted on sourceforge in CVS. This is the first version I personally used.
* 2009 until 2010: Synergy+ by [Sorin Sb√¢rnea and later Nick Bolton and a few more](https://web.archive.org/web/20090319014135/http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/) -hosted on Google Code. The original Synergy was not maintainer any more. [Nick Bolton apparently joined in 2009 or 2010 as a member](https://web.archive.org/web/20110820190333/http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/people/list)
* Synergy+ and Synergy joining into Synergy-Foss (late 2010 [on redmine](https://web.archive.org/web/20101014181637/http://synergy-foss.org/)) and Synergy-Project (2014, [own website](https://web.archive.org/web/20141109020711/http://synergy-project.org/) and [code on github under the name synergy, not symless](https://web.archive.org/web/20141114011053/https://github.com/synergy)).
* 2016 this became a product under the company name [Symless](https://web.archive.org/web/20160630194628/http://symless.com/synergy/) with Synergy as a product with binaries being sold.
* In 2018, [Barrier](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier) made [the first releases](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier/releases/tag/v2.0.0-RC1) as a fork from symless/synergy
* In 2022, [Input-Leap](https://github.com/input-leap/input-leap) was forked from Barrier
* In 2024, the original open source project, Synergy, got renamed to [Deskflow](https://github.com/deskflow/deskflow). The name Synergy is now only used for the commercial offering which uses the Deskflow (what formerly was known as Synergy). Deskflow can also be used standalone. In the process, they also added a [history document](https://github.com/deskflow/deskflow/wiki/History) to their wiki.
